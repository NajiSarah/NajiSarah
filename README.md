I create websites to help students, especially language learners
who live abroad

If you want to learn Dutch in the shortest time, welcome to my page https://sarahnaji.netlify.app/

I am working on suggesting links of useful educational sites and video links

I went through a difficult experience to learn the Dutch language, due to the poor educational resources on the Internet, compared to English or French websites.So I created a page that shortens your effort by collecting the resources you need to learn a new language

Currently, I am working on pages to help learners of Dutch and Arabic, and in the future there will certainly be other languages
